# Design Your Data Collection (Classical Approach)

## Overview

The **classical approach** to data analysis begins with a clear research question and then designs a data collection strategy tailored to answer it. The data does not yet exist when the study is planned—the researcher controls *how* it is gathered, *from whom*, and *under what conditions*. This deliberate design is the hallmark of traditional statistical practice.

## Core Principle

> **Design first, collect second, analyze third.**

The classical approach treats data collection as a **designed experiment** or a **carefully structured survey**. By controlling the data-generation process, the researcher can make strong claims about causality, quantify uncertainty precisely, and minimize bias.

## Three Classical Study Types

### 1. Observational Studies

The researcher observes and records data **without intervention**. Useful when manipulation is impractical or unethical, but limited to identifying associations rather than causal relationships.

### 2. Controlled Experiments

The researcher **manipulates** one or more variables and **randomly assigns** subjects to groups. The gold standard for establishing causality because randomization balances known and unknown confounders.

### 3. Sample Surveys

The researcher selects a **representative sample** from a population and collects data through structured questionnaires or interviews. Enables inference about the population when studying every member is infeasible.

## Strengths of the Classical Approach

- **Causal inference**: Randomized experiments can establish cause-and-effect relationships.
- **Known uncertainty**: Because the sampling mechanism is designed, standard errors, confidence intervals, and p-values have clear probabilistic interpretations.
- **Bias control**: Random sampling and random assignment directly address selection bias and confounding.
- **Reproducibility**: A well-documented design can be replicated by other researchers.

## When This Approach Works Best

- The research question is specific and well-defined.
- It is feasible to design and execute a study (time, budget, ethics).
- The population of interest is accessible for sampling or experimentation.
- Causal claims are needed (e.g., clinical trials, A/B tests, policy evaluations).

## Limitations

- **Cost and time**: Designing and running experiments or large-scale surveys is expensive and slow.
- **Ethical constraints**: Many important questions cannot be studied experimentally (e.g., the effect of poverty on health).
- **Scope**: The classical approach works best for structured, well-defined problems; it is less suited to open-ended exploration of massive, unstructured datasets.
- **Generalizability**: Laboratory experiments may not reflect real-world conditions.

## Key Takeaways

- The classical approach prioritizes **design** to ensure that the data can answer the research question with known precision.
- Its greatest strength is the ability to make **causal** and **inferential** claims with well-quantified uncertainty.
- It remains indispensable in medicine, social science, and policy evaluation, where the stakes of incorrect conclusions are high.
