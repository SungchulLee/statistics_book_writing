## How to Use This Book

Each section pairs mathematical exposition with runnable Python code. To get started:

1. Review the [prerequisites](math/logic_sets.md) to ensure the necessary background is in place.
2. Set up your Python environment following the [computational tools guide](tools/python_basics.md).
3. Work through the chapters sequentially — later chapters build on concepts introduced earlier.

## Conventions

- Mathematical notation follows standard conventions; see [Linear Algebra Notation and Conventions](math/linear_algebra.md) for details.
- Python code uses NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy throughout. All code is compatible with Python 3.10+.
- Sections marked with $\star$ contain optional advanced material.
