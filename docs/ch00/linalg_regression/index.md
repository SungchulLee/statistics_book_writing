# Appendix A: Linear Algebra for Regression

## Overview

This appendix provides the linear algebra foundations needed for understanding regression. We cover special matrix types (diagonal, idempotent, symmetric, positive definite, projection), and connect matrix theory to statistical results (quadratic forms, sampling distributions).

## Learning Objectives
