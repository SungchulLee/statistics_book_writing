# A/B Testing and Experimental Design

## Overview

A/B testing applies ANOVA and hypothesis testing principles to compare treatments in controlled experiments.

## Design Principles

- **Randomization**: Randomly assign subjects to treatment groups
- **Control**: Include a baseline/control group
- **Replication**: Ensure adequate sample size per group

## Connection to ANOVA

A/B testing with $k > 2$ groups is a one-way ANOVA. The F-test determines if any group differs, followed by post-hoc comparisons to identify which groups differ.
