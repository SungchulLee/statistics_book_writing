# ANOVA Exercises

## Exercise 1: Test Scores Based on Test Time

A psychologist wants to determine if there is a significant difference in test scores based on the time students take the test. Three groups of students (morning, afternoon, and evening) take a standardized test, and their test scores are as follows:

```
Morning: 85, 92, 89, 90, 87
Afternoon: 76, 81, 82, 80, 78
Evening: 93, 95, 97, 92, 94
```

Perform a one-way ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference in test scores between the three-time groups with a significance level of 95%. Remember to check assumptions and conduct post hoc tests if needed.

## Exercise 2: Three Different Workout Routines

An exercise coach wants to investigate how three different workout routines affect weight loss for their clients. The coach assigns 15 clients into three groups (5 participants per group): high-intensity interval training (HIIT), traditional strength training, and yoga. After ten weeks, the coach records the weight loss (in pounds) of each participant:

```
HIIT: 10, 8, 9, 10, 7
Strength Training: 7, 6, 6, 8, 5
Yoga: 4, 4, 3, 5, 6
```

Perform a one-way ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference in weight loss between the three workout routines with a significance level of 95%. Remember to check assumptions and conduct post hoc tests if needed.
