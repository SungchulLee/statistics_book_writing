# Significance Level and Decision Rules

## Overview

The **significance level** $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is true (Type I error rate).

## Decision Rules

- **p-value approach**: Reject $H_0$ if $p \leq \alpha$
- **Critical value approach**: Reject $H_0$ if the test statistic falls in the rejection region

## Common Significance Levels

| $\alpha$ | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 0.10 | Weak evidence against $H_0$ |
| 0.05 | Moderate evidence (most common) |
| 0.01 | Strong evidence |
| 0.001 | Very strong evidence |
