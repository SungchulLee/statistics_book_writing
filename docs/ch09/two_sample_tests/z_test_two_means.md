# Two-Sample Z-Test for μ₁−μ₂

## Overview

Tests whether two population means differ when both population variances are known.

## Test Statistic

$$
Z = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - \delta_0}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2/n_1 + \sigma_2^2/n_2}}
$$

where $\delta_0$ is the hypothesized difference (usually 0).
