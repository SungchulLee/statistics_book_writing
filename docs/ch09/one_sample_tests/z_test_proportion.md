# Z-Test for p (Proportion)

## Overview

The one-sample Z-test for proportions tests whether a population proportion equals a hypothesized value.

## Test Statistic

$$
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}
$$

where $\hat{p} = X/n$ is the sample proportion.

## Conditions

- $np_0 \geq 10$ and $n(1-p_0) \geq 10$ for the normal approximation to be adequate.
