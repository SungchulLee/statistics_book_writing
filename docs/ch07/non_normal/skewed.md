# Skewed Distributions

## Overview

When the data distribution is skewed, the sample mean and median can differ substantially.

## Effects of Skewness

- **Right-skewed**: Mean > Median > Mode (e.g., income data, financial returns)
- **Left-skewed**: Mean < Median < Mode

## Estimation Considerations

- The sample mean remains unbiased regardless of skewness
- For highly skewed data, the median may be a more representative measure of center
- Confidence intervals for the mean may require larger samples for adequate CLT approximation

## Transformations

Log or Box-Cox transformations can reduce skewness and improve the performance of mean-based methods.
