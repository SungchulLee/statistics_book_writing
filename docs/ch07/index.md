# Chapter 7: Estimation of Mean and Variance

## Overview

This chapter applies general estimation theory specifically to the mean and variance. We examine the sample mean's properties (bias, consistency, efficiency), variance estimators (including Bessel's correction), Gaussian MLE, and robust alternatives.
