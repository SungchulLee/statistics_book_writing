# Chapter 3: Probability, Random Variables, and Limit Theorems

## Overview

This chapter builds the probability foundation. Starting from sample spaces and axioms, we develop random variables, expectation, and variance, culminating in the powerful limit theorems (LLN, CLT) that connect probability to statistics.
