# Chapter 20: Multiclass Classification and Softmax Regression

## Overview

This chapter extends binary classification to the multiclass setting. We develop softmax regression (multinomial logistic regression), discuss cross-entropy loss and optimization, multiclass evaluation metrics, and compare strategies like one-vs-rest and one-vs-one.
