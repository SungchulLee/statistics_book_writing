# Chapter 18: Correlation and Causation

## Overview

This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of correlation and causation—two ideas that are central to statistical reasoning and data interpretation. While correlation quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, causation implies that changes in one variable directly produce changes in another. Confusing the two is one of the most common and consequential errors in data analysis.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Define and compute** the Pearson correlation coefficient and interpret its magnitude and sign.
2. **Distinguish** between positive, negative, and zero correlation using scatter plots and numerical summaries.
3. **Recognize** ecological correlation and the ecological fallacy, understanding why group-level correlations can misrepresent individual-level relationships.
4. **Identify** survivorship bias in data analysis and explain how it distorts observed correlations.
5. **Differentiate** between correlation and causation, identifying confounding variables that can create spurious associations.
6. **Describe** the criteria for establishing causation, including temporal precedence, covariation, and elimination of confounders.
7. **Apply** statistical correlation tests (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) to assess the significance of associations between variables.
