# When to Use Paired vs Independent Designs

## Overview

Choosing between paired and independent designs affects both the confidence interval width and interpretation.

## Paired Designs

- Same subjects measured twice (before/after)
- Matched pairs based on confounding variables
- Reduces variability by controlling for individual differences

## Independent Designs

- Different subjects in each group
- Simpler logistics but potentially higher variability
- Required when pairing is not possible

## Key Decision Factor

Use paired designs when individual-level correlation is expected to be positive, as this reduces the standard error of the difference.
