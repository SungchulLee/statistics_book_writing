# Chapter 8: Confidence Intervals

## Overview

A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for an unknown parameter, together with a measure of how confident we are that the interval contains the true value. This chapter covers the construction of confidence intervals for means, proportions, and variances in one-sample, two-sample, and paired-sample settings.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain the frequentist interpretation of confidence intervals
- Construct and interpret CIs for means, proportions, and variances
- Choose between z-intervals and t-intervals based on sample size and known/unknown variance
- Construct two-sample CIs for differences in means, proportions, and variance ratios
- Compute paired-sample CIs for the mean difference
- Understand the relationship between confidence level, margin of error, and sample size
